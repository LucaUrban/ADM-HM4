Goals of this assignment were: writing important algorithms and functions from scratch. 

__`Usage instructions (should you want to execute our code):`__

	To run our code it isn't necessary to download the datasets, you only have to download the folder and run the code written to complete each task.
 
The repository includes the following files:
1. __`main.ipynb`__: 
     > A Jupyter notebook which provides all the exercises one by one.
			
2. __`ex1 HM4.ipynb`__:
      > A Jupiter Notebook file which contains our solution to the first exercise that is about the Bloom Filter. 

3. __`HW4 Exercise 2.ipynb`__:
      > A Jupiter Notebook file which contains our solution to the second exercise that is about the Counting Sort. 
      
4. __`Clustering.ipynb`__:
      > A Jupiter Notebook file which contains our solution to the third exercise that is about the K-Means. This file is related to the **clustering_lib.py** that contains all the functions used into this file.
      
5. __`clustering_lib.py`__:
      > A Python file gathering the functions used into the Clustering.ipynb file. 
      
6. __`Part 4.ipynb`__:
      > A Jupiter Notebook file which contains our solution to the first exercise that is about the K-Means and when it can go wrong.
      
7. __`theoretical_lib.py`__:
      > A Python file containing the functions used into the Part 4.ipynb file.
