Goals of this assignment were: writing important algorithms and functions from scratch. 

__`Usage instructions (should you want to execute our notebook):`__

	To check the functionality of the code it is not necessary to get any dataset, you only have to download the folder and run what we wrote to complete each task.
 
The repository includes the following files:
1. __`main.ipynb`__: 
     > A Jupyter notebook which provides solutions to all the exercises, one by one.
      
2. __`clustering_lib.py`__:
      > A Python file gathering the functions used to complete the third task. 
      
3. __`theoretical_lib.py`__:
      > A Python file containing the functions used to solve the fourth task.

__`Team members: Giorgio Maria Mandolini - Luca Urban - Mahdi Charif `__
